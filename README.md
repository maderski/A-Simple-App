# A-Simple-App

A small app that uses Compose and the JSONPlaceHolder fake API to display a list of selectable users.  When the user is selected, the user details is shown 
and the location of the company the user is associated with can be viewed on a map.  Sometimes the fake service returns locations in the middle of the ocean! :D
